    Sift Science user events, which are mined for identity, behavioral, and network
    patterns that correspond to past fraud. Sift Science also pools fraud patterns
    across its network of customers. The network strengthens as more data streams
    in. Customers can also &ldquo;train their own model&rdquo; and tailor their results
    via a simple interface.
